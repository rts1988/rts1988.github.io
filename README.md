## About Me

[link to another page 2](/page2.md)

Hi there! I'm Arati Santhanakrishnan, a data scientist  based in Vancouver, BC. I have a diploma in Data Science from BrainStation, a PhD in chemical engineering from Michigan State University, and 3 years' industrial research and development experience in the semiconductor industry. 

My background in chemical engineering research (PhD, 2015) in both academia and industry has involved generating, analyzing and deriving conclusions from data on a daily basis. For my PhD dissertation, I optimized parameterized models for complex kinetic reaction systems in MATLAB, and designed catalysts for green chemistry. At my job as a process engineer in the semiconductor manufacturing industry, I used experimental designs including interaction parameters for process optimization of complex plasma depositions and A/B testing next generation hardware solutions. 

More recently, I have become enamored by the possibilities of big data. I taught myself Python and natural language processing, and have consulted at Simon Fraser University to machine grade student argumentative essays for educational psychology studies and provide writing and learning analytics. 

I recently graduated from an intensive 12-week diploma program in Data Science at BrainStation where I've maintained a 94.7% average grade, and am was a teaching assistant for their September 2022 in-person cohort. My coursework has sharpened and formalized my methodologies for working with larger datasets, machine learning and deep learning. 

I excel at combining first principles domain knowledge, common sense, and disciplined statistics methodology to dig deep and find lasting solutions rather than band aid fixes. Personally, I am passionate about continuous improvement and growth. I hope to join a team that shares my love of data, since it both informs and makes measurable our attempts to reach our full potential.

I have two divergent passions that I want to leverage my data science and analytics experience in:  improving manufacturing processes and in educational technology.

### INDEPENDENT PROJECTS IN LEARNING ENGINEERING:

My vision is to empower students by making self-regulated learning a more effective and engaging experience. Over the last year, I have been exploring various tools to implement that vision.  I have self-taught myself Python, some natural language processing, probabilistic inference, and have been reading about cognitive load theory and self-regulated learning.  I have been working on some projects to enable personalized learning path generation and reading material selection and computer assisted knowledge base construction and testing.
